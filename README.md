Running Made Simple is a resource hub for _anyone_ to get started in running. Built with next.js, TailwindCSS and React. Our main value proposition is the ease of using calculators to understand your training zones better. We also have a 2.4km Training Plan Generator that generates your training plans to ace your next 2.4km with less than 60 minutes of training per week. (Where got time?!) 

## 2.4km Training Plan Generator

As simple as keying in 3 metrics:
1. Most recent / best estimate of 1.2km race time
2. Birthdate
3. Race date 8-16 weeks from now.
